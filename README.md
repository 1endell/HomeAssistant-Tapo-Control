# HomeAssistant: Tapo Control

Custom component - Tapo control - to control Tapo camera features

**This custom component is in very early development right now. A lot of things will be changing.**

Because of that, HACS, versioning etc will come after a first stable release soon.

Use at your own risk.

## Installation:

Copy contents of custom_components/tapo_control/ to custom_components/tapo_control/ in your Home Assistant config folder.

## Usage:

Add to configuration.yaml:

```
tapo_control:
  - host: [IP ADDRESS TO TAPO CAMERA]
    username: [USERNAME SET IN ADVANCED OPTIONS IN CAMERA APP]
    password: [PASSWORD SET IN ADVANCED OPTIONS IN CAMERA APP]
```

You are able to add multiple cameras.

## Services

This custom component creates tapo_control.* entities in your Home Assistant. Use these entity_id(s) in following service calls.

**set_preset**

Rotates your camera to preset.

Example:
```
{
  "preset_id":1,
